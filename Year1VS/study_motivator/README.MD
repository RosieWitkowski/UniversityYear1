# About 
A fun, simle CLI project to help gamify productivity (and practice some basic programming techniques, such as input validation, file management and importing helper files).
Add/remove points, use those points to purchase tickets, and exchange tickets for spins on the prize wheel! Prizes include a list of earnable titles, or customizable difficulty levels (e.g. you may determine 'watch a show' is a medium prize for you, or for a child 'stickers' are a small prize).
