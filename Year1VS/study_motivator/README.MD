A quick and small fun project to help encourage studying (and other activites, such as chores) in a game-ifed way.
Doing tasks earns a predtermined amount of points, with a small random bonus applied. These can be exchanged for tickets, used to spin a random prize generator (split into easy - most likely -, medium, hard).
